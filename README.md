# Tello
Created a java application to emulate backend of a Project Management App Tello.

This is my most modular and full flegged application till date.
I have tried to incorporate as many Design patterns and good coding practices as I could think of without over engineering the code.
Added functionality like add tasks to the board, creating boards, users, lists
